# BigDebuffs

BigDebuffs is an _extremely lightweight_ addon that hooks the Blizzard raid frames to increase the debuff size of crowd control effects. Additionally, it replaces unit frame portraits with debuff durations when important debuffs are present.

The addon menu can be accessed by typing /bd or /bigdebuffs.

### Downloading

To download this addon, hit the **green "Code" button** and then select `Download ZIP`.

Once the addon is finished downloading, extract the contents to your `Interface/AddOns` directory and **importantly** rename the folder from `BigDebuffs-WoTLK-master` to `BigDebuffs`.

>**Backport Notes:**
> The backport is based on BfA BigDebuffs. However, the backport does not contain any raid frame 
> modifications (number of debuffs shown / crowd control effects) since the
> new raid frames do not exist in WotLK (they were implemented in Cataclysm).
> The backport is essentially a much improved version of LoseControl.

 I'd like to thank the following people for their contributions to this release:
> [jordon][1] for the base addon, as developed throughout MoP-BfA (and possibly further)
> [jakeswork][2] for his completion of the WotLK aura list, minor bug fixes and the Warrior stance logic addition.
