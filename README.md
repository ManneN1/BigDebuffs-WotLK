# BigDebuffs

BigDebuffs is an _extremely lightweight_ addon that hooks the Blizzard raid frames to increase the debuff size of crowd control effects. Additionally, it replaces unit frame portraits with debuff durations when important debuffs are present.

The addon menu can be accessed by typing /bd or /bigdebuffs.

### Downloading

To download this addon, hit the **green "Code" button** and then select `Download ZIP`.

Once the addon is finished downloading, extract the contents to your `Interface/AddOns` directory and **importantly** rename the folder from `BigDebuffs-WoTLK-master` to `BigDebuffs`.

>**Backport Notes:**
> The backport does not contain any raid frame modifications (number of debuffs shown / crowd control effects) since the
> new raid frames do not exist in WotLK (they were implemented in Cataclysm).
> The backport is essentially a much improved version of LoseControl.
