# BigDebuffs

BigDebuffs is an _extremely lightweight_ addon which replaces unit frame portraits with auras, stances and interrupts whenever present.

The addon menu can be accessed by typing /bd or /bigdebuffs.

### Downloading

To download this addon, hit the **green "Code" button** and then select `Download ZIP`.

Once the addon is finished downloading, extract the contents to your `Interface/AddOns` directory and **importantly** rename the folder from `BigDebuffs-WoTLK-master` to `BigDebuffs`.

### Backport Notes
The backport is based on BfA BigDebuffs. However, the backport does not contain any raid frame modifications (number of debuffs shown / crowd control effects) since the new raid frames do not exist in WotLK (they were implemented in Cataclysm). The backport is essentially a much improved version of LoseControl.

The backport now supports the backported version of **[Masque][1]**!
